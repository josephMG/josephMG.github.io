終於把我的部落格改成Astro了...雖然這是我2024的代辦事項。遷移完以後就要開始來補文章了。好，雖然有點晚，但還是來review一下2024：

1. 開始了一個新的AI side project，選擇用第一次接觸的Python Fastapi + Nextjs實作，前期也真是熬了一陣子，不過是真的滿有意思的
2. 幫客戶上線了一個新的服務，同時也不落掉維護、更新既有產品線
3. 從2024開始把部落個從Hexo改寫成Astro，後來忙（懶）了一陣子，一直到最近才完成
4. 學會用n8n來處理一些自動化任務，同時用它來為我的github PR做code review。為什麼不直接串Github Copilot? 因為不用錢啊
5. 從10月開始我每週有更多時間了，也因此可以找更多Part time or case來做。
6. 完成了一次家庭旅遊，放下工作全家人一起去大阪跟京都玩。

再來2025應該會是個更忙碌的一年，過個農曆年先來好好調適一下！

Finally, I’ve migrated my blog to Astro… although this was one of the tasks for 2024. After finishing the migration, I need to start writing more blogs on it. Good, although it’s a little late, I still want to review my 2024:

1. I started a new AI side project, choosing to implement it with Python FastAPI + Next.js, which was a pretty long and tiring period at the beginning, but it was really interesting.
2. I launched a new service for a client, while also maintaining and updating existing product lines.
3. I started migrating my blog from Hexo to Astro, although I finished it in 2025.
4. I learned how to use n8n to handle some automation tasks, and I used it to implement AI code review for my GitHub pull requests (because it’s free!).
5. Since October, I’ve had more time each week, so I can look for more part-time or case work.
6. I completed a family trip to Osaka and Kyoto!

Looking ahead to 2025, it’s going to be a much busier year! Let’s take a good rest before the Lunar New Year!
