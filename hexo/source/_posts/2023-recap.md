2023結束了，案子每天都在趕進度，配合發布記者會時程，除了開發新服務、還要改寫翻新原有的舊服務。2023可以說是個很累也很穩定的一年，這邊紀錄跟回顧一下。
<!-- more -->

- 穩定的金流！！
- 手上有個案子固定每天跟著業主上下班，唯一差異是我是全遠端，完全不用進公司，想找同事的時候還可以約一下去他們公司走走、一起做事。
- 為了升級React版本，規劃並將多個react class component為functional component，同時把沒有人敢碰、將近2000行的class component首頁主服務元件改寫成functional component。
- 跟某個業主方的工程師們一起開發了新的服務，其中包含串接第三方API、身份辨識功能等等，耗時了將近十個月。
- 一個月翻新客戶原有的舊案子，並藉由此案初步導入github actions CI/CD，最後於年底協助整合github actions做前後端自動部署。
- 碰到了WebRTC，實作拍照、錄影等等功能
- 替業主ReactJS導入Typescript，專心研究並實作react design pattern，也在團隊內部做技術分享
- ChatGPT or LLM實在是離我很遠，我只能持續關注web3、blockchain世界的發展

總結來講2023很沉穩地結束了，希望2024有更不一樣的挑戰~

Now, it's the end of 2023. Thank to the press conference, I had been keeping up with the release schedule for almost an entire year. During this period, I needed to roll out a new service and rewrite an existing service. However, 2023 was both fatiguing and stable. Here's my recap of 2023.

- Enjoying a stable cash flow.
- As a fully remote engineer, I adhere to the working hours of one of my customers. Although I don't have to be onsite, I can still go to office and work with them.
- For upgrading React version, I devised a plan and rewrote many `class components` to `functional components`, including a massive class component with more than 2000 lines, which is used in their main service.
- Collaborating on the release of a new service with my customer's engineers. Over the entire year, we integrated third-party APIs, optical character recognition (OCR), and GPS.
- Redesigning an existing service in one month. Furthermore, I introduced Github actions to handle CI/CD during this period and helped my customer deploy their frontend and backend code through Github actions in December 2023.
- Initiating the use of WebRTC to capture photos and record videos on mobile.
- Integrating Typescript and emphasizing React design patterns. I refactored codebases by implementing react design patterns and shared their usage with the frontend team.
- Continuously learning Web3 and blockchain technology.

Yes, 2023 was quite  a steady year. I hope my 2024 will be even more challenging.
